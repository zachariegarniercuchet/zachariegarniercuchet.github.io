Hi! I'm **Zacharie Garnier-Cuchet**, an AI researcher and M.Sc. student in computer engineering at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) and [MILA - Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en), supervised by [Amal Zouaq](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/amal-zouaq) and [Prof. Philippe Langlais](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~felipe/brand_new_home/creative-design/public_html/index.php?lg=en).

I began in French engineering schools studying mathematics and physics, but discovering NLP transformed my path entirely. When large language models first emerged, I was captivated by machines capable of coherent reasoning, a moment that reshaped my academic identity and drove me to understand how intelligent systems learn and reason.

**My research focuses on:**

* **Legal NLP** — Automatic detection and resolution of legal references in judicial decisions, involving structured reasoning, document parsing, and representation learning for complex texts.
* **Representation & Contrastive Learning** — Building embeddings and semantic models for large-scale text understanding.
* **Learning Dynamics** — Contributing to optimization research, including a **NeurIPS workshop paper** on loss landscapes and network stability.

I also serve as a **teaching assistant** for NLP at Polytechnique Montréal.

Growing up between **Montréal** and rural **France** taught me how environment shapes thought and values. This awareness now drives my interest in **Trustworthy AI**, **interpretability**, and **alignment**, building transparent models that support democratic values rather than amplify inherited biases.

*How do models acquire internal structure? How can learning systems amplify human insight over bias? How do we build AI for a safer, more equitable society?*

If these questions resonate with you, I'd love to connect. Find my publications and contact information below.
